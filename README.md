Flow ecosystem lacks community tooling and infrastructure. LinkLock enables communities and individuals to create membership programs (in form of membership NFTs) and distribute them to their audience/users. We also support membership content gating/authorization functionality out of the box.

### Apps and Packages

- `examples/gate-backend`: Showcases how you can use LinkLock to validate your members on the backend
- `apps/platform`: demo platform enables people to buy memberships from creators and communities to support them financially
- `apps/scanner`: Flow event indexing server to retrieve active members
- `packages/react`: React library with membership checkout modal  
- `packages/client`: library for handling core protocol interactions 
- `packages/domains`: library for retrieving account info from well-known Flow domain systems
